# ChainWatcher

Hi! I have created this project which is available publicly via [this link](https://chainwatcher-gilt.vercel.app/).

It uses the following technologies to combine the requested features:

- NextJS 13.2 as **React** Meta-framework (We're using the brand new app directory)

- **Prisma** (& **Planetscale**) as database for storing views for hashes (useful for widgets)

- **Vercel** as hosting solution, it was chosen due to simplicity of deploying and having CDN and SSR solution out of the box.

- Storybook 7 (RC) is used to view & document shared components in the sites. Some JEST tests are made for visual testing via Storybook interactions.

- Cypress 12 is used for E2E tests.

- Tailwind / Shadcn / RadixUI were used for styling of the components. Please note that components in `./components/ui` were provided by [Shadcn Docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)

- Zod ‚ù§Ô∏è, a small library that converts `unknown` to fully typed definitions. When receiving input from users, zod is a must.

- Prettier / Eslint to ensure consistent code style across the whole project. This is even especially useful with more contributors.

- Usage of localstorage for storing state required for notifications. This ensures that data is not lost after reload.

- Usage of cookie for currencies, the perfect data source that can be used across browser and server.

# Project Requirements

Projects requirements were given via a PDF file, I extracted them into below list:

## Features

- [x] Use ReactJS

- [x] retrieves address and transaction information from the BTC

blockchain.

- [x] It also allows a user to subscribe for changes to specific

hashes.

- [x] Each subscribed hash should generate a notification on the UI.

- [x] Furthermore, the user should be able to select in which currency

the values should be displayed (USD, EUR or BTC).

## Deliverables

- [x] Solution code

- [x] Tests

- [x] Documentation to set up / run / test the project

- [x] Upload to GitHub

## Questions

- [x] Logic and code complexity - How easy will my code be for it to be

maintained by someone else? Am I using good practices and proper

design patterns?

- [x] Test coverage - Is my code tested? Are all scenarios considered?

- [x] Requirement coverage - Is the application doing what it is meant

to be doing?

## Issues

While working on the project, some small parts of the requirements were a bit unclear to me:

- I had trouble understanding what ‚ÄúTotal BTC unspent‚Äù means in the context of an address. I am currently returning the balance as part of the value.

- Triggering notifications for hash changes can become very expensive in terms of API consumptions, therefore it was limited to 3 addresses and 3 transactions.

## Possible Improvements

The project was very interesting, and even though I have worked in a Web3 project at @**BetssonGroup** (mainly covering ETH), I haven't focused that much on details such as confirmations.

I felt like working on all below improvements, however that would go beyong the 10h limit üò≠

- When tracking page views we are trusting user input (hash).

Ideally this is sanitised before this is included in database.

- The application supports 3 subscriptions (per client) for notifications to ensure limited use of Blockchain API. This feature is quite costly, a shared caching mechanism could possibly help to increase the amount of subscriptions per client.

- More Unit tests (especially for all utils).

- Individual components are mostly made for specific container sizes. Usage of container queries would allow them to be used in

multiple websites.

- No use of Design System, so some components are themed under various colours made specifically for this website. These

components might not look as good on different sites.

- Pages are not tested via storybook due to storybook limitation of retrieving async components

- Use websockets for notifications instead of polling system.
